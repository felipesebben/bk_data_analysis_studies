    "<p>We can start by discussing the <b>mean</b>. First, the <b>trim mean</b> is higher than the mean. This indicates that probably some extreme value to the left was pulling the mean. By removing these extreme points, our mean increased by a small fraction. Now, by weighted the mean on the number of home points, the mean increased to 1.68. I really cannot understand this value that well. Does it mean that the mean goal difference is higher when weighting on the number of home points? In any case, we can affirm that the mean is affected by extreme values and by removing them, we get a more robust result.</p>\n",
    "<p>Now, the median also increased to a 2 goal-difference when weighting on home points.</p>\n",
    "<p>Regarding the spread of the data, by analyzing the <b>range</b> of the dataset, we got to understand how <b>wide</b> its distribution is. And it is quite wide, which tells us that, there are indeed extreme values, or, in other words, games in which the goal difference was significantly high! The range is <b>11</b>, which is very high considering a median of 0 and a mean of 0.39. When we apply the <b>IQR</b>, however, we get to see that 50% of the observations are concentrated in a narrower interval, that is, <b>3</b>. This means that the distance between the 75th and the 25th quantiles is 3, which is quite narrow considering such a wide range. When analyzing the <b>standard deviation</b>, we get a result of <b>1.91</b>, which tells us that we can expect a deviation of 1.91 goals from the mean of 0.39. This is quite high yet expected given the presence of extreme values. If we apply the <b>MAD</b>, we get a lower result: <b>1.48</b>, which indicates the robustness of such estimate in the presence of extreme values. This means that we can expect a mean deviation of 1.48 goals from the mean, which is 0.</p>\n",
    "<p>Finally, regarding the skewness of the data, the <b>mean-median skewness</b> is <b>0.21</b>. This result indicates that the mean is higher than the median, which hints at the presence of extreme values to the right, that are pulling the mean. In a normal distribution, since the mean and the median would be equivalent, this value would be zero.</p>\n",
    "<h2><b>3</b>. Conclusion | Final remarks</h2>\n",
    "<p>By calculating different statistics, we get a more nuanced view of our dataset. We can understand the effects of outliers on important estimates, and use alternative methods to try to overcome the uncertainty that we get in such scenarios. While using all these statistics may be unpractical on a daily basis, learning which ones are relevant for each case is an important skill to be honed!\n",
