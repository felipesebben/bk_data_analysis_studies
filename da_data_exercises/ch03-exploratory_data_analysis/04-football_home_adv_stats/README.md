<h1>Chapter 3 | Data Exercise #2 | EDA with data on used cars</h1>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>In this notebook, you will find my notes and code for Chapter 3's <b>exercise 2</b> of the book <a href="https://gabors-data-analysis.com/">Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy</a>, by Gábor Békés and Gábor Kézdi. The question was: 
<p>1. Pick another season from the <code>football</code> dataset.</p>
<p>Assignments:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Examine the extent of home team advantage in similar ways to our case study.</li>
    <li>Compare the results and discuss what you find.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<p>This was an interesting data exercise. I read, filtered and plotted data from two different football league seasons. Then, I compared both results and made observations on changes between each of their distributions.</p>
<p>I decided to pick season 2017/2018 to compare with the book's case study, which used season 2016/2017.</p>
<p>My conclusion was that while we could observe a home team advantage in season 2017/2018, it was not as great as the previous season. There was a lower proportion of wins at home, an increased number of games ending in a draw, and a lower proportion of games with a higher goal difference, which hints at more competitive matches.</p>
