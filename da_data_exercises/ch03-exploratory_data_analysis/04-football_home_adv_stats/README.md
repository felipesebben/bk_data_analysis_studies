<h1>Chapter 3 | Data Exercise #2 | <code>football</code> dataset | Alternative statistics </h1>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>In this notebook, you will find my notes and code for Chapter 3's <b>exercise 4</b> of the book <a href="https://gabors-data-analysis.com/">Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy</a>, by Gábor Békés and Gábor Kézdi. The question was: 
<p>4. Choose the same 2016/2017 season from the <code>football</code> dataset..</p>
<p>Assignments:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Produce a different table with possibly different statistics to show the extent of home team advantage.</li>
    <li>Compare the results and discuss what you find.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<p>I took advantage of this exercise to review some alternative estimates. Besides calculating them, I gave a brief description of their characteristics and definitions.</p>
<p>I divided the estimates into three different sessions according to their type:</p>
<ul>
<li>Central value (location)</li>
<ul>
<li>Mean</li>
<li>Trimmed mean</li>
<li>Weighted mean</li>
<li>Median</li>
<li>Weighted median</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Spread (variation)</li>
<ul>
<li>Range</li>
<li>Inter-quartile range</li>
<li>Deviation</li>
<li>Median absolute deviation from the median</li>
</ul>
<li>Skewness</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Then, I created a table describing those statistics to replicate the one found in the book's case study. I discussed the differences between these alternative estimates and those used in the original exercise.</p> 
<p>I hope you enjoy it and feel free to contact me!</p>
