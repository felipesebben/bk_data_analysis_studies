<h1>Chapter 3 | Data Exercise #1 | <code>hotels-europe</code>: EDA</h1>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>In this notebook, you will find my notes and code for Chapter 3's <b>exercise 1</b> of the book <a href="https://gabors-data-analysis.com/">Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy</a>, by Gábor Békés and Gábor Kézdi. The question was: 
<p>1. Pick another city beyond Vienna from the <code>hotels-europe</code> dataset.</p>
<p>Assignments:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a table comparable to the one used in our case study.</li>
    <li>Visualize the distribution of the distance and the distribution of price and compute their summary statistics.</li>
    <li>Are there extreme values? What would you do with them? Describe the two distributions in a few sentences.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<p>You will find more than just what was required by the command of the question. I reproduced the data cleansing steps that we had done in previous chapters. Also, as I went through the book's EDA steps, I decided to plot individual summary statistics and charts to observe the changes as we dealt with particularities of this dataset.</p>
<p>I decided to pick Rome as a different city, and that lead to particular challenges. It was a rewarding experience, especially when having to deal with extreme values. The distribution of hotels in prices and distances is different from Vienna's, albeit in a subtle manner.
<p>I hope you enjoy it and feel free to contact me!</p>
