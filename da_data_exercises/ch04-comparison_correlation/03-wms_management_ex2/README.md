<h1>Chapter 4 | Data Exercise #3 | <code>wms-management-survey</code> | Comparison and correlation</h1>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>In this notebook, you will find my notes and code for Chapter 4's <b>exercise 3</b> of the book <a href="https://gabors-data-analysis.com/">Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy</a>, by Gábor Békés and Gábor Kézdi. The question was: 
<p>3. Using the <code>wms-management-survey</code> dataset:</p>
<p>Assignments:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pick a country of your choice.</li>
    <li>Create a management score from a meaningful subset of the 18 items (e.g. managing talent).</li>
    <li>Carry out an analysis to uncover the patterns of association with employment.</li>
    <li>Summarize what you find and comment on which visualization you find the most useful.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Comments:</h2>
<p>I decided to pick <b>Italy</b> as a more contrasting example to the one used by the book (Mexico). I decided to create a performance score based on the individual score indices used by the survey. Overall, Italian firms showed a <b>moderate</b>, positive correlation between firm size and performance score. On average, this score increased as the number of employees increased, showing a higher correlation coefficient as firm sizes increased. Still, this correlation was <b>not that strong</b>, and we could observe a high degree of <b>variability</b> on management score. Finally, when taking note of the correlation coefficient among particular industries, we could notice that some had nearly <b>no correlation at all</b>, while a few showed scores above the average.</p>
