<h1>Chapter 4 | Data Exercise #1 | <code>hotels-vienna</code> | Comparison and correlation</h1>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>In this notebook, you will find my notes and code for Chapter 4's <b>exercise 1</b> of the book <a href="https://gabors-data-analysis.com/">Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy</a>, by Gábor Békés and Gábor Kézdi. The question was: 
<p>1. Use the data on used cars collected from a classified ads site (according to Chapter 1 data exercise).</p>
<p>Assignments:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Visualize the distribution of price and the distribution of age, and compute their summary statistics.</li>
    <li>Are there extreme values? What would you do with them? Describe the two distributions in a few sentences.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<p>Data was scraped from <a href="www.olx.com.br">OLX</a>, an popular Brazilian web-based ads sales platform. These steps are available in chapter 1's data exercises, in which I created a script to scrape what I needed from the website.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy it and feel free to contact me!</p>
