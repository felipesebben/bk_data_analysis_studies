<h1>Chapter 4 | Data Exercise #2 | <code>hotels-vienna</code> | Comparison and correlation</h1>
<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>In this notebook, you will find my notes and code for Chapter 4's <b>exercise 2</b> of the book <a href="https://gabors-data-analysis.com/">Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy</a>, by Gábor Békés and Gábor Kézdi. The question was: 
<p>1. Are central hotels better? To answer this, using the <code>hotels-vienna</code> dataset (as discussed in Chapter 3, Section 3.A1), create two categories by the distance from center: <b>close</b> and <b>far</b>.</p>
<p>Assignments:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Show summary statistics.</li>
    <li>Compare stars and ratings and prices for close and far hotels.</li>
    <li>Create stacked bar charts, box plots, and violin plots.</li>
    <li>Summarize your findings.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Comments:</h2>
<p>Central hotels in Rome <b>tend to be better yet more expensive</b>. That was my overall finding. You can expect better ratings and stars (albeit with a higher degree of variability), yet prices are the <b>main difference</b>. There was a significant increase on average prices, with a higher level of spread. Hotels farther away, on the other hand, focused on providing cheaper and more consistent quality levels, which reflected on a higher concentration of ratings and stars at a mid-level - don't expect 5 stars or excellent ratings here, but also don't expect very high prices.</p>
